## HOW TO… use union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference set of operations in Python!

These operations will allow you to quickly logically separate data based on conditions or attributes from a set or collections of datasets.

For this you need python (version 3.8<) as well as the following packages imported: matplotlib.pyplot and geopandas.

The example shows you how to:

•	Set a collection of values belonging to groups.
•	Return a list of the sets based specific operations (Union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference)
•	Apply these set operations in a spatial context. 

Set operations are very useful in geospatial analysis and having confidence using them will save both time and googling!
